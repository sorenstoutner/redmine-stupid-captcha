Stupid captcha Redmine plugin
=================================

Redmine plugin that adds a stupid captcha to the account registration page.

- Installation: just clone it to your plugins directory, run 'bundle' and restart Redmine.
- Configuration: on the plugin setting page, enter your captcha word.
- Compatibility: tested with Redmine 2.3, but I assume it works with older versions as well.
