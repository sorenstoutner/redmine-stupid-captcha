On 2 July 2013, Christoph Dwertmann forked Redmine Simple Captcha to create the Recaptcha Redmine plugin and then modified it to use Google's reCAPTCHA.  I took inspiration from some of his work to figure out how to make Redmine Simple Captcha compatible with Redmine >= 5.x.  His work is released under the MIT license, but the repository contains no copyright information.
